# Pseudocode "Average an Array

## Learning Goals

- Create Code from Pseudocode

## Introduction

A simple test case to practice your skill at applying the Flatiron Process is
to pseudocode the averaging (mean) of an Array of numbers. Keep in mind, this
is _pseudocode_: do not use programming language built-in math function

## Create Code from Pseudocode

Perform the steps in the Flatiron process and document them in the file
`pseudocode.html`.

We've included the steps for you simply locate the text `Replace this text with
your response`. Delete it and enter your text for that particular section.

For example:

## Submitting this Lab

When you're done providing the psudocode, you'll need to submit this lab using
`learn submit`.

## Conclusion

With your pseudocode in place, you're ready to code the flawless implementation
of this method. Try to get everything working the very first time. Pseudocoding
takes the variability out of _encoding_ ideas in programming languages.
